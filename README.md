## 📖 About this script

This password validator was originally provided by ChatGPT based on rules discussed in CS50’s Lecture 0. 

Instead of copy-pasting it, I **typed the entire code manually in my Linux VM** and spent over 25 iterations debugging and fixing syntax/logic issues myself. That hands-on fixing helped me understand:
- String manipulation
- Input validation
- Logical conditions

I didn’t create the core idea from scratch, but **fixing and analyzing the errors myself** gave me a much deeper understanding than just copy-pasting would have.
