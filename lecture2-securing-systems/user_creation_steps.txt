# User Creation & Remote Access Setup:

## 1. Created a new user account named "testuser" :
sudo adduser testuser 

## 2. Gave "testuser" a password when prompted.

## 3.verified testuser was added:
cat /etc/passwd | grep testuser 

## 4. Gave "testuser" sudo privileges which can be useful 
sudo usermod -aG sudo testuser 

## 5. Confirmed that the ssh server was installed:
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install openssh-server

## 6. Edited the ssh configuration to allow password authentication and the new user:
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

changed/added the following lines:
Port 2222
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication yes 
AllowUser testuser
(others are mentioned in the config file)

## 7. Restarted ssh to apply changes ( had to learn this by getting persistent errors):
sudo systemctl restart ssh 

## 8. Allowed port 2222 in the fireawll:
sudo ufw allow 2222

## 9. Logged in remotely via putty from windows to my kali vm:
- (Provided my kali ip and the port number to access the vm)

## 10. Confirmed successful login using password:
- (Used the username allowed in the ssh config and entered password when prompted)

Note: Public key authentication was attempted but skipped due to persistent issues, Might revisit it later. Current setup uses password-based login.
